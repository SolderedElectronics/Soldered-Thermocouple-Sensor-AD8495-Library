The AD8495 is a precision instrumentation amplifier with a thermocoupler cold junction compensator. It produces a high output of 5mV/Â°C directly from the thermocouple signal. The output from the breakout board is taken by the ADC pin form the microcontroller and calculations are done to display the value in Celsius/Fahrenheit.
